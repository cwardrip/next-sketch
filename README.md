# NextSketch

Introducing your next-level prototyping tool — NextSketch. The tool streamlines the process of creating Next.js prototypes by simplifing your workflow and allows you, developers, to focus on designing and creating your application.

Features

Create your custom endpoint by submitting a name through the ‘New Endpoint’ form and selecting optional unique file conventions that are reserved for Next.js applications. Each route will be created within only the app folder and can be deleted through the (—) button. All routes and its files are displayed upon creation via a tree hierachy.

Drag-and-drop elements from the ‘Add Elements’ section to ‘My Page’ section to customize each file within your routes. Movement of elements are reflected by various colored highlighting. When a user hovers an element over a valid drop are, the area will turn green, blue, or red, indicating where the element will be dropped. A variety of elements such as div and form tags can have children, which is displayed by a blue highlighted area when hovering elements over the middle region of a container tag. Green and red areas depict either top or bottom placement of an element, respectively. Elements can also be dragged directly above, below, or within an element, and with no designated highlight, the element will be dropped to the bottom ‘My Page’ section. After you are satisifed with your prototype, click the ‘Export’ button to download your prototype to your local machine as a zip file.

Congrats on making your first mock up of a Next.js application.
